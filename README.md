# Learning Golang

### Here you can find a few examples of basic Golang functionalities
Most of the examples in this repository were based on the book **"Programando em Go: crie aplicações com a linguagem da Google"**

**[Documentation:](https://github.com/lauraadalmolin/golang_first_steps/documentation.txt)** in this particular file, you can find some information that I consider to be helpful and important about Golang.
